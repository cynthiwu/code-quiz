## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a simple code quiz that tests the user on their basic knowledge of web development. The quiz is timed, with the final time at quiz completion being a recorded score. The quicker the completion, the higher the score, the higher the ranking. Final scores are tracked on a separate webpage which can be accessed by the user.
